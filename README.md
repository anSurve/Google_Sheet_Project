# Google_Sheet_Project

The objective of this project is to read a google sheet using google sheet API, apply a formula on the column in it and save entire data in a different file in google drive.
After this part is done, the next part is to display the rows one by one to the user. First column of a row contains an english sentence and the second column contains the hindi translation of the first column. The user is supposed to verify if the translation is correct, if not user should update the translation.
After this activity is performed by user the code should calculate the time taken by users to translate each row. This time taken by user and the correct translation should be updated back to the file.
